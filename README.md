# web-dev-portfolio
Full-stack school web application project built with React, Typescript & C# featuring REST API integration & state management 

This project is a full-stack school web application built as part of my Web Development course.
It simulates a real-world calendar & attendance platform where users can authenticate, manage sessions, and track attendance.


During this project I learned how to:

-Build and structure a React + TypeScript front-end

-Create REST APIs using C# and ASP.NET

-Handle authentication & state management

-Connect front-end and back-end systems

-Work in an Agile / Scrum team environment

-Use Git & GitHub for collaboration and version control
